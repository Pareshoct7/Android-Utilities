## Android Utilities

While developing Andorid apps, I gathered the functionalities which I repeatedly needed and kept them in a utility class. The number of these functions grew, and I needed to manage the “Permissions” in a clean easy way, therefore, I decided to create my own library. 
This library provides the following utilities:

| Utility     |
|-------------|
| Permissions	| 
| Memory 	    | 
| Battery     | 
| Device info | 
| Network	    |
